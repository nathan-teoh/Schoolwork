Comments:

I could not figure out how to implement keyboard shortcuts. However, everything else should be as required in the specifications. The program is littered with coding smells. I tried my best to avoid it by applying what I have learned so far in CSCD212, but I did not do it very successfully. This is also my first time programming any GUI, and it was a very very steep learning curve. 


I do not really think anything in this assignment is worthy of extra credit.
